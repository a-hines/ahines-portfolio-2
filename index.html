            <p>
                Alexa Hines grew up in the historic river town of Burlington, Iowa. She moved to Kirksville, Missouri, in 2005
                to attend Truman State University where she majored in English. Alexa graudated with her Bachelor of Arts in English
                in 2009 and went straight into Truman State's Master of Arts in Education program one week after graduation. She 
                completed her student teaching on an Army base in Bamberg, Germany before returning to Iowa and working in the private 
                sectore for two years. Alexa began her teaching journey at the American School of Kosova in Prishtina, Kosovo. Alexa has
                been teaching for 10 years and has taught in private, public, and charter schools both in-person and online. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Although she has a great love for teaching, Alexa is expanding outside of the classroom by working toward full-stack 
                certification through Butler's online coding bootcamp. She is currently in Phase 1 of bootcamp where she is learning html,
                css, Git, JavaScript, third-party APIs, and server-side APIs. She is looking forward to begin able to update this portfolio 
                with her next phase of learning including Node.js, object-oriented programming, express.js servers, MySQL, and much more.
